# File Upload and Session Management API

### Description
This project is a file upload API that allows users to upload files, retrieve them through a unique session URL, and download them with an expiration time. The files are stored on Cloudinary, and the sessions are managed with unique session IDs. The files will expire and be automatically deleted after a set period.

### Features
Upload files (images, videos, PDFs, and other file types).

Each upload is associated with a unique session ID.

Files can be accessed through a session URL.

Files expire after a certain period and are automatically deleted.

Session data is managed using cookies to maintain the userâ€™s session.

Cloudinary integration for file storage.

npm or yarn

### Usage
#### File Upload
To upload files, you can use the following API endpoint:

* POST /upload/:sessionId

Where :sessionId is a unique session identifier. You can retrieve this session ID by visiting the /session-url endpoint.

#### Session URL
To get the session URL, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

* GET /session-url

It will return a URL like:
```
{
  "url": "http://localhost:3000/sessionId"
}
````
You can visit this URL to view and download the files uploaded to the session.

### Expiration and Cleanup
Files uploaded to a session will expire after 5 minutes. After this period, they will be automatically deleted from Cloudinary.
